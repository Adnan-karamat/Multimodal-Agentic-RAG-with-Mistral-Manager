Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, which involves feeding large datasets into algorithms to help them learn and improve their ability to perform tasks without explicit programming. It’s a form of pattern recognition and statistical analysis that enables computers to learn and make decisions based on data.\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms can be broken down into three main categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training the algorithm on labeled data, where the desired output is already known. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves training the algorithm on unlabeled data, where the desired output is not known. Reinforcement learning involves training the algorithm to learn by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.\\n\\nMachine learning has numerous applications in various industries, including healthcare, finance, marketing, and transportation. It can be used for tasks such as image and speech recognition, predictive modeling, and natural language processing. Machine learning models can be trained on data from various sources, including databases, sensors, and social media platforms.\\n\\nThe benefits of machine learning include improved accuracy and efficiency, automated decision-making, and the ability to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to human analysts. However, machine learning also comes with challenges, such as the need for large amounts of data, the potential for bias, and the difficulty of interpreting complex models.\\n\\nIn conclusion, machine learning is a powerful technology that enables computers to learn and make decisions based on data.

However, the idea of simulating these networks was not developed by a single individual but rather evolved over time with contributions from many researchers. Some key figures in the development of artificial neural networks include Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, who published a landmark paper in 1943 outlining the concept of an artificial neuron; Perceptron, a single-layer artificial neural network, was proposed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957; and Paul Werbos and Geoffrey Hinton made significant contributions to the development of backpropagation, a critical training algorithm for multi-layer neural networks, in the 1980s. So, it's not accurate to attribute the invention of neural networks to a single person. Instead, it's a collaborative effort of many researchers over several decades.\"}\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFacePipeline\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-02T18:12:51.670467Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-02T18:12:51.670875Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-02T18:13:14.799901Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-02T18:12:51.670828Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-02T18:13:14.799104Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
